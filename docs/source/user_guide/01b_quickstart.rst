===========

Based on our experience using nbgrader in a course setting with many students
and sections, the following quick start workflow steps are best practices that
we have developed for using nbgrader.

* nbgrader is installed
* nbgrader is up-to-date
* nbgrader extension is installed and activated if using the extension toolbar
  with Jupyter notebook.

Letâ€™s get started with a simple workflow.
